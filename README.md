# Spherical World
This project is an attempt to create voxel-based game in pure javascript. It was resurrected after 4 years of inactivity and right now under heavy refactorings.

## Requirements
Latest NodeJS, Latest Chrome/Firefox, Latest Docker

## Running
### Server
```bash
npm run start-server
```

linux users may need to run docker under sudo:

```bash
sudo npm run start-server
```

`nvm` is not working with `sudo` out of the box, if you use `nvm` to manage your `node` versions, you may need to apply this workaround to make `nvm` compatible with `sudo`:
```bash
n=$(which node);n=${n%/bin/node}; chmod -R 755 $n/bin/*; sudo cp -r $n/{bin,lib,share} /usr/local
```
### Client
`npm start`
